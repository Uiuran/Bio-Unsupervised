# Bio-Unsupervised
Pattern Matching Algorithms for Biological and Artistical Inspired Images

- Currently development is on Google Colab Research. Download the .ipynb and open it on Google Colab Research service. Please note the file with direct link to my implementation.

# Autograph Feature Request

- We issued a feature resquest to automatizate name-architecure handling through Ultrametric Spaces**. This is part of an effort to make the original data greater through transfer learning and hyperparam tuning automatized via protocol [FUTURE].

# DataAutoArch

- Effort to do Autographing with the above protocol (HPP TLP) with Semi-Supervised (Naturaly Supervised as mentioned by (((ل()(ل() 'yoav))) Learning, Unsupervised Learning. An Effort To Give the DATA all the AsSETS [FUTURE].
